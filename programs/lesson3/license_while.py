Requirements:

Input Validation:
- The program should prompt the user to enter their age.
- If the input is not a positive integer, the program should display an error message and prompt the user again.
- This process should continue until the user enters a valid age (a positive integer).

Age Check:
- If the user's age is 18 or older, the program should display: "Congratulations! You are eligible for a driver's license."
- If the user's age is between 16 and 17 (inclusive), the program should display: "You are eligible for a learner's permit."
- If the user's age is less than 16, the program should display: "Sorry, you are not eligible for a driver's license yet."

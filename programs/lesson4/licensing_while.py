Problem Statement:

Write a Python program that determines a student's eligibility for a driver's license or learner's permit based on their age. Your program should prompt the user to enter their age. If the age provided is 18 or above, the program should display a message congratulating the student on being eligible for a driver's license. If the age provided is 16 or above but less than 18, the program should inform the student that they are eligible for a learner's permit. If the age provided is below 16, the program should notify the student that they are not yet eligible for a driver's license.

Your program should continuously prompt the user for their age until a valid age (a positive integer) is entered. Ensure that your program handles invalid inputs gracefully, providing clear instructions to the user on how to enter a valid age.
